This is a simple memory game build by using HTML5, CSS3, Js. The game has features like showing of cards on click and once the cards mismatch then the cards will again be hidden within 0.5s. This showing and hiding of cards will occur by a smooth transition. If the cards matches then the cards will remain visible.

• Each time the player mismatch a pair of cards his/her number of 'Failed Attempts' will decrease by 1 • Every time a pair of cards are matched the score will increase by 1

Once the user reaches the maximum score an alert function is fired showing the player that he has own.

The initially the color of 'Failed Attempts' and 'Score' is black but as the player Failed Attempts gets non zero its color changes to '#f45725' and similarly for score the color changes to 'gold'.

This project's interface uses DOM Manipulation to create a toggle effect on the hamburger button. This project also contains SVG amination and a glass interface to enhance player experience.
