This is a simple memory game build by using HTML5, CSS3, Js. The game has featues like showing of cards on click and once the cards mismatch then the cards will again be hidden within 0.5s. This showing and hidding of cards will occur by a smooth transition. If the cards matches then the cards will remain visible.

• Each time the palyer mismatch a pair of cards his/her number of 'Failed Attempets' will decrease by 1
• Every time a pair of cards are matched the score will increase by 1

Once the user reaches the maximum score a alert function is fired showing the player that he has own.

The initially the color of 'Failed Attempets' and 'Score' is black but as the player Failed Attempets gets non zero its color changes to '#f45725' and similarly for score the color changes to 'gold'.

This project's interface uses DOM Manipulation to create a toggle effect on the hamburger button. This project also contains SVG amination and a glass interface to enhance player experience.
